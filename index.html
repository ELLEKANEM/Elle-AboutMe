                <h2>Hello, I'm Elma Charles Ekanem</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a versatile and enthusiastic professional with a strong academic and professional foundation, complemented by a Master of Science in International Business and Entrepreneurship from De Montfort University, Leicester, UK, and a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Chemistry from Veritas University, Nigeria. <br>
                    Currently, I am expanding my technical skillset through a self-paced Full-Stack Web Development program on Udemy, covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, Web3, and Decentralized Applications (DApps). <br>

                    With over two years of administrative experience in customer service and the insurance industry, I have honed my ability to manage schedules, coordinate tasks, and deliver results in dynamic and high-pressure environments. I am particularly interested in pursuing a Senior PA role in a finance organization, where I can apply my organizational expertise, proactive mindset, and ability to align administrative priorities with strategic objectives. <br>

                    I am passionate about continuous learning and adapt quickly to new training, ensuring seamless transitions into roles that demand precision, collaboration, and excellence. My commitment to fostering teamwork and driving success makes me eager to contribute to a finance organization’s growth and operational efficiency.
